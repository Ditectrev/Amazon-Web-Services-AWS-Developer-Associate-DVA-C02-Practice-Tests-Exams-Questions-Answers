### A Developer has been asked to build a real-time dashboard web application to visualize the key prefixes and storage size of objects in Amazon S3 buckets. Amazon DynamoDB will be used to store the Amazon S3 metadata. What is the optimal and MOST cost-effective design to ensure that the real-time dashboard is kept up to date with the state of the objects in the Amazon S3 buckets?

- [x] Use an Amazon CloudWatch event backed by an AWS Lambda function. Issue an Amazon S3 API call to get a list of all Amazon S3 objects and persist the metadata within DynamoDB. Have the web application poll the DynamoDBtable to reflect this change.
- [ ] Use Amazon S3 Event Notification backed by a Lambda function to persist the metadata into DynamoDB. Have the web application poll the DynamoDB table to reflect this change.
- [ ] Run a cron job within an Amazon EC2 instance to list all objects within Amazon S3 and persist the metadata into DynamoDB. Have the web application poll the DynamoDB table to reflect this change.
- [ ] Create a new Amazon EMR cluster to get all the metadata about Amazon S3 objects; persist the metadata into DynamoDB. Have the web application poll the DynamoDB table to reflect this change.

### A Developer must repeatedly and consistently deploy a serverless RESTful API on AWS. Which techniques will work? (Choose TWO)

- [ ] Define a Swagger file. Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy the Swagger file.
- [ ] Define a Swagger file. Use AWS CodeDeploy to deploy the Swagger file.
- [x] Deploy a SAM template with an inline Swagger definition.
- [x] Define a Swagger file. Deploy a SAM template that references the Swagger file.
- [ ] Define an inline Swagger definition in a Lambda function. Invoke the Lambda function.

### An existing serverless application processes uploaded image files. The process currently uses a single Lambda function that takes an image file, performs the processing, and stores the file in Amazon S3. Users of the application now require thumbnail generation of the images. Users want to avoid any impact to the time it takes to perform the image uploads. How can thumbnail generation be added to the application, meeting user requirements while minimizing changes to existing code?

- [x] Change the existing Lambda function handling the uploads to create thumbnails at the time of upload. Have the function store both the image and thumbnail in Amazon S3.
- [ ] Create a second Lambda function that handles thumbnail generation and storage. Change the existing Lambda function to invoke it asynchronously.
- [ ] Create an S3 event notification with a Lambda function destination. Create a new Lambda function to generate and store thumbnails.
- [ ] Create an S3 event notification to an SQS Queue. Create a scheduled Lambda function that processes the queue, and generates and stores thumbnails.

### A company is using Amazon API Gateway to manage access to a set of microservices implemented as AWS Lambda functions. Following a bug report, the company makes a minor breaking change to one of the APIs. In order to avoid impacting existing clients when the new API is deployed, the company wants to allow clients six months to migrate from v1 to v2. Which approach should the Developer use to handle this change?

- [ ] Update the underlying Lambda function and provide clients with the new Lambda invocation URL.
- [ ] Use API Gateway to automatically propagate the change to clients, specifying 180 days in the phased deployment parameter.
- [x] Use API Gateway to deploy a new stage named v2 to the API and provide users with its URL.
- [ ] Update the underlying Lambda function, create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with the updated Lambda function as its origin.

### A company developed a set of APIs that are being served through the Amazon API Gateway. The API calls need to be authenticated based on OpenID identity providers such as Amazon or Facebook. The APIs should allow access based on a custom authorization model. Which is the simplest and MOST secure design to use to build an authentication and authorization model for the APIs?

- [x] Use Amazon Cognito user pools and a custom authorizer to authenticate and authorize users based on JSON Web Tokens.
- [ ] Build a OpenID token broker with Amazon and Facebook. Users will authenticate with these identify providers and pass the JSON Web Token to the API to authenticate each API call.
- [ ] Store user credentials in Amazon DynamoDB and have the application retrieve temporary credentials from AWS STS. Make API calls by passing user credentials to the APIs for authentication and authorization.
- [ ] Use Amazon RDS to store user credentials and pass them to the APIs for authentications and authorization.

### Where should an Elastic Beanstalk configuration file named healthcheckur1.config be placed in the application source bundle?

- [ ] In the root of the application.
- [ ] In the bin folder.
- [ ] In healthcheckur1.config.ebextension under root.
- [x] In the .ebextensions folder.

### A Developer has implemented a Lambda function that needs to add new customers to an RDS database that is expected to run hundreds of times per hour. The Lambda function is configured to use 512MB of RAM and is based on the following pseudo code. After testing the Lambda function, the Developer notices that the Lambda execution time is much longer than expected. What should the Developer do to improve performance?

![Question 385](images/question385.jpg)

- [ ] Increase the amount of RAM allocated to the Lambda function, which will increase the number of threads the Lambda can use.
- [ ] Increase the size of the RDS database to allow for an increased number of database connections each hour.
- [x] Move the database connection and close statement out of the handler. Place the connection in the global space.
- [ ] Replace RDS wit Amazon DynamoDB to implement control over the number of writes per second.

### A static website is hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket. Several HTML pages on the site use JavaScript to download images from another Amazon S3 bucket. These images are not displayed when users browse the site. What is the possible cause for the issue?

- [ ] The referenced Amazon S3 bucket is in another region.
- [ ] The images must be stored in the same Amazon S3 bucket.
- [ ] Port 80 must be opened on the security group in which the Amazon S3 bucket is located.
- [x] Cross Origin Resource Sharing must be enabled on the Amazon S3 bucket.

### Amazon S3 has the following structure: S3://BUCKET/FOLDERNAME/FILENAME.zip Which S3 best practice would optimize performance with thousands of PUT request each second to a single bucket?

- [ ] Prefix folder names with user id; for example, s3://BUCKET/2013-FOLDERNAME/FILENAME.zip.
- [ ] Prefix file names with timestamps; for example, s3://BUCKET/FOLDERNAME/2013-26-05-15-00-00-FILENAME.zip.
- [ ] Prefix file names with random hex hashes; for example, s3://BUCKET/FOLDERNAME/23a6-FILENAME.zip.
- [x] Prefix folder names with random hex hashes; for example, s3://BUCKET/23a6-FOLDERNAME/FILENAME.zip.
